Developers of machine translation systems need to monitor the effect of daily changes to their systems in order to evaluate the systems.To judge the quality of a machine translation, one measures its closeness to one or more reference human translations according to a numerical metric.

BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of text which has been machine-translated from one natural language to another. Few translations will attain a score of 1 unless they are identical to a reference translation.

Translations may vary in word choice or in word order even when they use the same words. And yet humans can clearly distinguish a good translation from a bad one. For example, consider these two candidate translations of a Chinese source sentence:

``
Candidate 1: It is a guide to action which ensures that the military always obeys the commands of the party.
``

``
Candidate 2: It is to insure the troops
forever hearing the activity guidebook
that party direct.
``
